    <p style="font-size: large; color: darkorange;">
        "Hello, World!" is often the first program that many aspiring programmers write when learning a new programming language. It serves as a simple introduction to the syntax and structure of a language, as well as the process of compiling or interpreting code. The program typically outputs the text "Hello, World!" to the screen, symbolizing the start of a programmerâ€™s journey into coding. Despite its simplicity, the "Hello, World!" program has a special place in programming culture, representing the first successful step toward mastering the art of coding in any language.
